The following examples show various ways lg may be used to communicate with sensors via the GPIO.

Although many are complete programs they are intended to be a starting point in producing your own code, not an end point.

?1|lgpio|C lgpio

Examples of C lgpio programs.

C rgpio programs may be run on any Linux computer.  The programs allow control of the local GPIO.

If your program is called foobar.c then build with

gcc -Wall -o foobar foobar.c -llgpio


?4|bench.c|2020-11-14|GPIO toggle
A crude benchmark of how many toggles a second can be completed.

?4|chipline.c|2020-11-14|gpiochip info
Prints gpiochip information and line information for each GPIO.

?4|dhtxx.c|2020-11-14|DHT11/22/XX
Reads the DHT series of temperature and humidity sensors.  The sensor type is autodetected.

?4|monitor.c|2020-11-15|Monitor GPIO
Monitors one or more GPIO as specified on the command line.

./monitor [chip:]gpio ...

chip specifies a gpiochip number.  gpio is a GPIO in the previous gpiochip (gpiochip0 if there is no previous gpiochip).

e.g.

./monitor 23 24 25 # chip0: 23,24,25
./monitor 0:23 1:0 5 # chip0: 23, chip1: 0,5

?4|tx_pulse.c|2020-11-14|Tx pulse
Demonstrates usage of the tx pulse function.

?4|tx_wave.c|2020-11-14|Tx wave
Demonstrates usage of the tx wave function.


?1|py_lgpio|Python lgpio

Examples of Python lgpio module scripts.

lgpio Python scripts may be run on any Linux computer with Python installed.  The scripts allow control of the local GPIO.


?4|bench.py|2020-11-14|GPIO toggle

Reads the DHT series of temperature and humidity sensors.  The sensor type is autodetected.

?4|errors.py|2020-11-14|Errors
Checks that the correct errors are reported when erroneous parameters are used.  The checks are limited in scope to those that can be detected without having any hardware connected.

?4|monitor.py|2020-11-15|Monitor GPIO
Monitors one or more GPIO as specified on the command line.

./monitor.py [chip:]gpio ...

chip specifies a gpiochip number.  gpio is a GPIO in the previous gpiochip (gpiochip0 if there is no previous gpiochip).

e.g.

./monitor.py 23 24 25 # chip0: 23,24,25
./monitor.py 0:23 1:0 5 # chip0: 23, chip1: 0,5

?4|tx_wave.py|2020-11-14|Tx wave
Demonstrates usage of the tx wave function.


?1|rgpio|C rgpio

Examples of C rgpio programs.

C rgpio programs may be run on any Linux computer.  The programs allow control of the GPIO on one or more networked Linux SBCs.

Each SBC needs the rgpiod daemon to be running.  The rgpiod daemon may be started with the command rgpiod &.

If your program is called foobar.c then build with

gcc -Wall -o foobar foobar.c -lrgpio


?4|bench.c|2020-11-14|GPIO toggle

?4|DS18B20.c|2020-11-14|DS18B20
Reads any DS18B20 temperature sensors connected to the 1-wire bus.  It demonstrates the remote file read abilities of the daemon.

?4|errors.c|2020-11-14|Errors
Checks that the correct errors are reported when erroneous parameters are used.  The checks are limited in scope to those that can be detected without having any hardware connected.

?4|files.c|2020-11-14|Files

./monitor [chip:]gpio ...

chip specifies a gpiochip number.  gpio is a GPIO in the previous gpiochip (gpiochip0 if there is no previous gpiochip).

e.g.

./monitor 23 24 25 # chip0: 23,24,25
./monitor 0:23 1:0 5 # chip0: 23, chip1: 0,5

The rgpio Python module may be run on any computer with Python installed. The scripts allow control of the GPIO on one or more networked Linux SBCs.

The computer need not be Linux, it may run Windows, Mac, etc, anything as long as it supports Python.

Each SBC needs the rgpiod daemon to be running.  The rgpiod daemon may be started with the command rgpiod &.
