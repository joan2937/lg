INTRO

rgs is a program which allows remote control of the GPIO and
other functions of Linux SBCs running the rgpiod daemon.

The rgpiod daemon must be running on the SBCs you wish to control.

*Features*

o reading and writing GPIO singly and in groups
o software timed PWM and waves
o GPIO callbacks
o pipe notification of GPIO events
o I2C wrapper
o SPI wrapper
o serial link wrapper
o simple file handling
o creating and running scripts on the rgpiod daemon

*Usage*

rgs {command}+

rgs will show the result of the command on screen.

The rgs process returns an exit status (which can be displayed with
the command echo $?).

...
RGS_OK            0
RGS_CONNECT_ERR 255
RGS_OPTION_ERR  254
RGS_SCRIPT_ERR  253 
...

If an error was detected a message will have been written to stderr.
This is likely to be more informative than the message returned by rgs.

Several commands may be entered on a line.  If present PROC and PARSE must
be the last command on a line.

*Notes*

rgs does not show the status of successful commands unless the
command itself returns data.  The status (0) will be returned to
rgs but will be discarded.

When a command takes a number as a parameter it may be entered as hex
(precede by 0x), octal (precede by 0), or decimal.

E.g. 23 is 23 decimal, 0x100 is 256 decimal, 070 is 56 decimal.

Some commands can return a variable number of data bytes.  By
default this data is displayed as decimal.  The rgs -a option
can be used to force the display as ASCII and the rgs -x
option can be used to force the display as hex.

E.g. assuming the transmitted serial data is the letters ABCDEONM

...
$ rgs serr 4 100 # assumes serial data available from handle 4
8 65 66 67 68 69 79 78 77

$ rgs -a serr 4 100
8 ABCDEONM

$ rgs -x serr 4 100
8 41 42 43 44 45 4f 4e 4d
...

*Permissions*

Generally objects created on the rgpiod daemon exist for the duration of the
socket connection.

For a Python script this will be for the duration of the script.  For a
program linked with rgpio this will be for the duration of the program.

For rgs it is the command line.

This means that the following command will achieve little

...
rgs go 0 # get handle to gpiochip 0
...

The daemon will delete the handle as soon as the rgs command has finished.

To preserve the handle it must be shared.

A lot of the examples will show the command c 1 (use share id 1).
This means the handle is preserved and may be used in subsequent commands.

. .
rgs c 1 go 0 # get and preserve handle to gpiochip 0
. .

If a command is privileged it is indicated in the notes for the
command.  The examples given here assume the daemon access control
system is not active (so any user can use privileged commands).

FO ::
This is a privileged command.  See [+permits+].

This function returns a handle to a file opened in a specified mode.

Upon success a handle (>=0) is returned.  On error a negative status code
will be returned.

The mode may have the following values.

      @ Value @ Meaning
READ  @   1   @ open file for reading
WRITE @   2   @ open file for writing
RW    @   3   @ open file for reading and writing

The following values may be or'd into the mode.

       @ Value @ Meaning
APPEND @   4   @ All writes append data to the end of the file
CREATE @   8   @ The file is created if it doesn't exist
TRUNC  @  16   @ The file is truncated

Newly created files are owned by the user that launched the daemon
with permissions owner read and write.

GP ::

This command starts software timed pulses on GPIO [#g#] .

Each cycle consists of [#mon#] microseconds of GPIO high
followed by [#moff#] microseconds of GPIO low.

PWM is characterised by two values, its frequency (number of cycles
per second) and its duty cycle (percentage of high time per cycle).

The set frequency will be 1000000 / (mon + moff) Hz.

The set duty cycle will be mon / (mon + moff) * 100 %.

E.g. if mon is 50 and moff is 100 the frequency will be 6666.67 Hz
and the duty cycle will be 33.33 %.

GPX ::

This command starts software timed pulses on GPIO [#g#] .

[#cyc#] cycles are transmitted (0 means infinite).  Each cycle
consists of [#mon#] microseconds of GPIO high followed by [#moff#]
microseconds of GPIO low.

PWM is characterised by two values, its frequency (number of cycles
per second) and its duty cycle (percentage of high time per cycle).

The set frequency will be 1000000 / (mon + moff) Hz.

The set duty cycle will be mon / (mon + moff) * 100 %.

E.g. if mon is 50 and moff is 100 the frequency will be 6666.67 Hz
and the duty cycle will be 33.33 %.

[#off#] is a microsecond offset from the natural start of the PWM cycle.

For instance if the PWM frequency is 10 Hz the natural start of each cycle
is at seconds 0, then 0.1, 0.2, 0.3 etc.  In this case if the offset is
20000 microseconds the cycle will start at seconds 0.02, 0.12, 0.22, 0.32 etc.

Another command may be issued to the GPIO before the last has finished.

If the last command had infinite cycles ([#cyc#] of 0) then it will be replaced
by the new settings at the end of the current cycle.  Otherwise it will be
replaced by the new settings at the end of [#cyc#] cycles.

Multiple pulse settings may be queued in this way.

P::

This command starts software timed PWM on GPIO [#g#] .

PWM is characterised by two values, its frequency (number of cycles
per second) and its duty cycle (percentage of high time per cycle).

PX::

This command starts software timed PWM on GPIO [#g#] .

PWM is characterised by two values, its frequency (number of cycles
per second) and its duty cycle (percentage of high time per cycle).

[#off#] is a microsecond offset from the natural start of the PWM cycle.

For instance if the PWM frequency is 10 Hz the natural start of each cycle
is at seconds 0, then 0.1, 0.2, 0.3 etc.  In this case if the offset is
20000 microseconds the cycle will start at seconds 0.02, 0.12, 0.22, 0.32 etc.

Another PWM command may be issued to the GPIO before the last has finished.

If the last PWM had infinite cycles ([#cyc#] of 0) then it will be replaced
by the new settings at the end of the current cycle.  Otherwise it will be
replaced by the new settings at the end of [#cyc#] cycles.

Multiple PWM settings may be queued in this way.

S ::

This command starts software timed servo pulses on GPIO [#g#] .

I would only use software timed servo pulses for testing purposes.  The
timing jitter will cause the servo to fidget.  This may cause it to
overheat and wear out prematurely.

SX ::

This command starts software timed servo pulses on GPIO [#g#] .

I would only use software timed servo pulses for testing purposes.  The
timing jitter will cause the servo to fidget.  This may cause it to
overheat and wear out prematurely.

Another servo command may be issued to the GPIO before the last has finished.

If the last command had infinite cycles ([#cyc#] of 0) then it will be replaced
by the new settings at the end of the current cycle.  Otherwise it will be
replaced by the new settings at the end of [#cyc#] cycles.

Multiple servo settings may be queued in this way.

GWAVE ::

This command starts a wave on GPIO group [#g#] .

[#p#] is a series of pulses to be transmitted on the GPIO group.

Each pulse is defined by the following triplet:

[#gbits#] the levels to set for the selected GPIO 
[#gmask#] the GPIO to select 
[#us#]    the delay in microseconds before the next pulse

Another wave command may be issued to the GPIO group before the
last has finished transmission.

Multiple waves may be queued in this way.

GBUSY ::

This command checks to see if a specified kind [#k#] of transmission
is ongoing on a GPIO or GPIO group [#g#] .

The command returns 1 if transmission is ongoing, otherwise 0.

GROOM ::

This returns the number of slots there are to queue further
transmissions of a specified kind [#k#] in the tx queue for
GPIO or GPIO group [#g#].

The command returns the number of free slots (0 for no free slots).

GDEB ::

This command sets the debounce time for GPIO [#g#] to [#us#] microseconds.

This command is only effective when the GPIO is being used as
a source of alerts.

Any level changes shorter than the debounce setting will be
discarded, i.e. they will not generate an alert.

Reported level changes will be timestamped [#us#] microseconds
after the level change.

GWDOG ::

This command sets the watchdog time for GPIO [#g#]
 to [#us#] microseconds.

This only affects alerts.

A watchdog alert will be sent if no edge alert has been issued
for that GPIO in the previous watchdog microseconds.

Note that only one watchdog alert will be sent per stream of
edge alerts.  The watchdog is reset by the sending of a new
edge alert.

The level is set to 2 for a watchdog alert.

operations to be performed are specified by the contents of [#bvs#]
which contains the concatenated command codes and associated data.

The following command codes are supported:

Name    @ Cmd & Data @ Meaning
End     @ 0          @ No more commands
Escape  @ 1          @ Next P is two bytes
Address @ 2 P        @ Set I2C address to P
Flags   @ 3 lsb msb  @ Set I2C flags to lsb + (msb << 8)
Read    @ 4 P        @ Read P bytes of data
Write   @ 5 P ...    @ Write P bytes of data

The address, read, and write commands take a parameter P.
Normally P is one byte (0-255).  If the command is preceded by
the Escape command then P is two bytes (0-65535, least significant
byte first).

The address defaults to that associated with the handle [#h#].
The flags default to 0.  The address and flags maintain their
previous value until updated.

bytes available to be read (which may be zero) and [#num#] bytes
will be returned.

off :: >= 0

The offset in microseconds from the nominal PWM pulse start.

p* ::
One or more triplets of [#gbits#], [#gmask#], and [#us#]
microsecond delay.

pars :: script parameters
The command expects 0 to 10 numbers as parameters to be passed to the script.

pat :: a file name pattern
A file path which may contain wildcards.  To be accessible the path
must match an entry in the [files] section of the permits file.

pdc :: thousandths of %
PWM duty cycle between 0 % (0) and 100 % (100000).

pf :: thousandths of Hz
PWM frequency between 0.1 Hz (100) and 10000 Hz (10000000).
Use  0 for off.

r :: register (0-255)
The command expects an I2C register number.

sef :: serial flags (32 bits)
The command expects a flag value.  No serial flags are currently defined.

sf :: Hz (40-500)
Servo frequency

spc :: SPI channel (>= 0)
The command expects a SPI channel.

spd :: SPI device (>= 0)
The command expects a SPO device.

spf :: SPI flags
See [*SPIO*].

spw :: 0=off, 500-2500 microseconds
Servo pulse width

str :: a string
The command expects a string.

t :: a string
The command expects a string.

us ::
The command expects a time interval measured in microseconds.

v :: value
The command expects a number.

v* ::
A list of one or more values.

wv :: word value (0-65535)
The command expects a word value.
