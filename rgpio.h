/*TEXT

rgpio is a C library which allows remote control of the GPIO and
other functions of Linux SBCs running the rgpiod daemon.

The rgpiod daemon must be running on the SBCs you wish to control.

*Features*

o reading and writing GPIO singly and in groups
o software timed PWM and waves
o GPIO callbacks
o pipe notification of GPIO alerts
o I2C wrapper
o SPI wrapper
o serial link wrapper
o simple file handling
o creating and running scripts on the rgpiod daemon
o a simple interface to start and stop new threads

*Usage*

Include <rgpio.h> in your source files.

Assuming your source is in prog.c use the following command to build

. .
gcc -Wall -o prog prog.c -lrgpio
. .

to run make sure the rgpiod daemon is running

. .
rgpiod&

 ./prog
. .

For examples see the lg archive file.

*Notes*

All the functions which return an int return < 0 on error

File

A file may only be opened if permission is granted by an entry in

remote access to files in a controlled manner.

Mode

The mode may have the following values.

Macro         @ Value @ Meaning
LG_FILE_READ  @   1   @ open file for reading
LG_FILE_WRITE @   2   @ open file for writing
LG_FILE_RW    @   3   @ open file for reading and writing

The following values may be or'd into the mode.

Macro          @ Value @ Meaning
LG_FILE_APPEND @ 4     @ Writes append data to the end of the file
LG_FILE_CREATE @ 8     @ The file is created if it doesn't exist
LG_FILE_TRUNC  @ 16    @ The file is truncated

Newly created files are owned by the user who launched the daemon
with permissions owner read and write.

This command will work for an output group as well as an input group. For an output group the value returned will be that last written to the group GPIO.

Note that this command will also work on an individual GPIO claimed as an input or output as that is treated as a group with one member.

After a successful read groupBits is set as follows.

Bit 0 is the level of the group leader.
Bit 1 is the level of the second GPIO in the group.
Bit x is the level of GPIO x+1 of the group.

If OK returns the number of entries left in the PWM queue for the GPIO.

On failure returns a negative error code.

If both pulse_on and pulse_off are zero pulses will be switched off
for that GPIO.  The active pulse, if any, will be stopped and any
queued pulses will be deleted.

Each successful call to this function consumes one PWM queue entry.

pulse_cycles cycles are transmitted (0 means infinite).
Each cycle consists of pulse_on microseconds of GPIO high
followed by pulse_off microseconds of GPIO low.

PWM is characterised by two values, its frequency
(number of cycles per second) and its duty cycle
(percentage of high time per cycle).

The set frequency will be 1000000 / (pulse_on + pulse_off) Hz.

The set duty cycle will be pulse_on / (pulse_on + pulse_off) * 100 %.

E.g. if pulse_on is 50 and pulse_off is 100 the frequency will
be 6666.67 Hz and the duty cycle will be 33.33 %.

pulse_offset is a microsecond offset from the natural start
of the pulse cycle.

For instance if the PWM frequency is 10 Hz the natural start of
each cycle is at seconds 0, then 0.1, 0.2, 0.3 etc. In this case
if the offset is 20000 microseconds the cycle will start at
seconds 0.02, 0.12, 0.22, 0.32 etc.

Another pulse command may be issued to the GPIO before the last
has finished.

If the last pulse had infinite cycles then it will be replaced by
the new settings at the end of the current cycle. Otherwise it will
be replaced by the new settings when all its cycles are compete.

sbc: >= 0 (as returned by [*rgpiod_start*]).

If OK returns a handle (>= 0).

On failure returns a negative error code.

A notification is a method for being notified of GPIO state
changes via a pipe.

Pipes are only accessible from the local machine so this function
serves no purpose if you are using the library from a remote machine.
The in-built (socket) notifications provided by [*callback*]
should be used instead.

The notification pipes are created in the library working directory.

Notifications for handle x will be available at the pipe
named .lgd-nfyx (where x is the handle number). E.g. if the
function returns 15 then the notifications must be
read from .lgd-nfy15.

Each notification occupies 16 bytes in the fifo and has the
following structure.

. .
typedef struct
{
   uint64_t timestamp; // alert time in nanoseconds
   uint8_t chip;       // gpiochip device number
   uint8_t gpio;       // offset into gpio device
   uint8_t level;      // 0=low, 1=high, 2=timeout
   uint8_t flags;      // none currently defined
} lgGpioReport_t;
. .

timestamp: the number of nanoseconds since the epoch (start of 1970)
chip: the gpiochip device number (NOT the handle). 
gpio: the GPIO. 
level: indicates the level of the GPIO 
flags: no flags are currently defined

For future proofing it is probably best to ignore any notification
with non-zero flags.

*scriptName::
The name of a [*shell_*] script to be executed.  The script must
be present in the cgi directory of the daemon's configuration
directory and must have execute permission.

*scriptString::
The string to be passed to a [*shell_*] script to be executed.

*secretsFile::
The file containing the shared secret for a user.  If the shared
secret for a user matches that known by the rgpiod daemon the user can
"log in" to the daemon.

seekFrom::
. .
LG_FROM_START   0
LG_FROM_CURRENT 1
LG_FROM_END     2
. .

seekOffset::
The number of bytes to move forward (positive) or backwards (negative)
from the seek position (start, current, or end of file).

ser_baud::
The speed of serial communication in bits per second.

ser_flags::
Flags which modify a serial open command.  None are currently defined.

*ser_tty::
The name of a serial tty device, e.g. /dev/ttyAMA0, /dev/ttyUSB0, /dev/tty1.

servoCycles:: >= 0
The number of servo pulses to generate.  A value of 0 means infinite.

servoFrequency:: 40-500 Hz
Servo pulse frequency

servoOffset:: >= 0
The offset in microseconds from the nominal servo pulse start.

share_id::
Objects created with a non-zero share_id are persistent and may be
used by other software which knows the share_id.

sleepSecs::
The number of seconds to delay.

spi_baud::
The speed of SPI communication in bits per second.

spi_channel:: >= 0
A SPI channel.

spi_device:: >= 0
A SPI device.

spi_flags::
See [*spi_open*] and [*bb_spi_open*].

thread_func::
A function of type gpioThreadFunc_t used as the main function of a
thread.

*txBuf::
An array of bytes to transmit.

uint32_t::
A 32-bit unsigned value.

uint64_t::
A 64-bit unsigned value.

*user::
A name known by the rgpiod daemon and associated with a set of user
permissions.

*userdata::
A pointer to arbitrary user data.  This may be used to identify the instance.

You must ensure that the pointer is in scope at the time it is processed.  If
it is a pointer to a global this is automatic.  Do not pass the address of a
local variable.  If you want to pass a transient object then use the
following technique.

In the calling function:

. .
user_type *userdata; 
user_type my_userdata;

userdata = malloc(sizeof(user_type)); 
*userdata = my_userdata;
. .

In the receiving function:

. .
user_type my_userdata = *(user_type*)userdata;

free(userdata);
. .

value:: 0-1
A GPIO level.

*values::
An array of GPIO values.

void::
Denoting no parameter is required

watchdog_us::
The watchdog time in microseconds.

wordVal::0-65535
A 16-bit word value.
